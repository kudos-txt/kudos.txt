# kudos.txt

Express gratitude to your contributors.

## Motivation

Thousands of Open Source Repositories are providing code. But we should never
forget, that this code is made by people. Are these people getting the gratitude
they deserve? We think, it is time to have a kudos.txt to express the gratitude
to all of your contributors and give them a place aside the git logs.

## Description

kudos.txt provides a format to express gratitude to your contributors. It is
easy to understand, easy to read for humans and machines and it does not force
you to present data, that you don't want to present.

<!-- TODO: Mich more detailed explanation -->

## Requirements

A Text Editor is helpful.
